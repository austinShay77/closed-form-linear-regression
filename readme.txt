To run the program:

    The listed libraries need to be installed, and the .csv file needs to be present at the same level as
    the hw2.py file.

    To run the program: python3 ./hw2.py

    On run it should print out the rmse and smape for the training and validation data.
    On line 89, you can change the argument S to make more or less folds. On completion it will print out
    the mean and standard deviation for that given list of rmse's.
